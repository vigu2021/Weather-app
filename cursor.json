Use Flask background tasks for scheduled API calls. Store historical weather data using SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL. Integrate an LSTM-based machine learning model for weather forecasting. Implement sentiment analysis to process user feedback on weather conditions. Ensure machine learning models are stored in 'ml_models/' and properly utilized in 'services/'. Implement an ETL pipeline with separate scripts for extraction, transformation, and loading of weather data into the database."
